# Windows 95 OEM Key Generator
This little tool allows you to act as an OEM and generate your own keys for Windows 95.
Windows 95 OEM Key algorithm was actually simple, just a bunch of date and year mixed with random numbers.
We implemented it in this little tool which is also easy to use.

## Usage
Using this tool is easy, just run it and press the "Generate" button to enjoy a Windows 95 key.
